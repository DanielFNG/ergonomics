This repository contains research code for learning human motion strategies via inverse musculoskeletal optimal control and simulating 
human-robot collaboration scenarios.

The code in this repository was used to generate simulations for two research papers which have been accepted for publication. Links to these
publications will be provided here upon publication.

Dependencies include OpenSim and OpenSim Moco. The code is a research prototype and is still undergoing active development.
